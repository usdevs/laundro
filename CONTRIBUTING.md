## Branching

- Long-lived branch: **`main`**
- Documentation branch: **`docs`**

Create a branch off `main` to start working on a feature/bugfix/test suite.

```sh
git branch <branch-type>/<description>

# Example
# git branch feature/optimize-logging
```

| Branch Type | Description                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `feature`   | brief explanation of what this feature entails |
| `bugfix`    | what is the bug                                |
| `testing`   | which component are you testing                |
| `devops`    | anything related to CI/deployment              |
| `docs`      | what are you updating in the docs              |

> **description** should be not include any whitespaces. Separate it with dashes/underscores.
